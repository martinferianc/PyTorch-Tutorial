# Convolutional Neural Network to classify clothes in the Fashion MNIST dataset

## Purpose

This repository is meant for personal learning purposes to get myself faimilar with PyTorch. The main projects and a tasks that are being solved here is classification of fashion items in the Fashion MNIST dataset and reinforcement learning in the OpenAI gym. 

I am closely following the tutorial given by [deeplizard](https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/v5cngxo4mIg). I have decided to follow this particular tutorial because it goes into a lot of detail, starting from individual operations on tensors to the actual classification of CNNs. It is also very slow-paced, which means I can actually remember what is going on. 

I hope this repo might also be useful to someone just to refresh their memories about PyTorch.

## Structure

All the code, together with comments (so that I do not forget what is going on) is in the `src/` directory.

- [Part 1](src/Introduction to PyTorch - Part 1 Tensors and operations.ipynb): Basic notes about operations on PyTorch tensors
- [Part 2](src/Introduction to PyTorch - Part 2 Building a CNN) : How to build a basic classifier
- [Part 3](src/Introduction to PyTorch - Part 3 Automatising a number of runs.ipynb) : Building an automatic runner for tweaking hyperparameters
