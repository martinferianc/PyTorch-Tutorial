# Convolutional Neural Network to classify clothes in the Fashion MNIST dataset

## Purpose

This repository is meant for personal learning purposes to get myself faimilar with PyTorch. The main project and a task that is being solved here is classification of fashion items in the Fashion MNIST dataset.

I am closely following the tutorial given by [https://deeplizard.com/learn/video/v5cngxo4mIg](deeplizard). I have decided to follow this particular tutorial because it goes into a lot of detail, starting from individual operations on tensors to the actual classification of CNNs. It is also very slow paced, which means I can actually remember what is going on. 

I hope this repo might also be useful to someone just to refresh their memories about PyTorch.

## Structure

All the code, together with comments (so that I do not forget what is going on) is in the `src/` directory.

- (src/Introduction to PyTorch - Part 1 Tensors and operations.ipynb)[Part 1] - Basic notes about operations on PyTorch tensors
- (src/Introduction to PyTorch - Part 2 Building a CNN)[Part 2] - How to build a basic classifier
